- Plan:
    - First create survival agent who tried to keep the life with no graphics, and maybe start off with Q-Learning.
    - Use different algorithms like DQN to improve it.
    - Start making newly born baby with graphics.

- Insights:
    - I thought NLP is the core of the AGI, but it might not as the case for Computer vision, and other things like continuousness be as dogs which don't use as high level language as we do, yet behave as more high intelligent creatures better than ChatGPT.
    - Read a paper Reward is enough
    - game theory is important?
    - Get ideas from wild animal like the one in Africa.

- AGI:
    - Needs body parts e.g., arms, legs.
        - Make scientific devices based on *1.
    - Able to talk through audio.

- AGI (without arms and legs only on computer):
    - Enviroments:
        - Might be in nature.
    - Agents:
        - Might be newly born baby.
    -Algorithms:
        - Maybe PPO or DQN? Check Comparison of reinforcement learning algorithms on https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning
        - also check out reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) 
    - Policy:
        - Has life, hunger, weight, and thirstiness maybe more medically detailed be added e.g., blood pressure.
        - He needs to earn money to buy food.
        - He looks and behaves like human being has 2 arms, legs.
        - biological brains are hardwired to interpret signals such as pain and hunger as negative reinforcements, and interpret pleasure and food intake as positive reinforcements. I
        - How can he act like a mosquito?
        - Can he surived meaning keep all the status as high as possible e.g., life, weight.
        - maximising survival time, minimising pain, maximising healthy food, avoiding accidents
        - I need to take weather into account
        - he needs to escape from pradetors e.g., lion, crocodile
        - Social intelligence is the ability to understand and interact effectively with other agents. This ability is often formalised, using game theory.
        - it may become injured
        - How to teach him a thing is scary or cute.
        - Build human aged between 3 ~ 5.
        - How to teach him words like banana actually showing banana. Not like how chatGPT is recoginising banana (predicting probable next words).
        - ability to imitate
        - memory, imagination, common sense, attention, reasoning, creativity
        - *1 Discover new theories in Scinece, and come up with new scientific devices (Phyiscs, Mathematics, Chemistry).
        Study Existing Theories - > Identify Shortcomings or Gaps - > Develop Mathematical Framework - > Make Predictions - > Seek Peer Review - > Experimental Verification - > Iterate and Refine. Can it do it?
        - Able to make games from simple to AAA class.
        - Play Mario game (RL).
        - Conversational Agents (RL).
        - unsupervised learning.
        - Neuroscience
        - Cognitive Science.
        - Translation.
        - Question- answering.
        - Sentiment analysis.
        - Coding.
        - AlphaZero (RL).
        - Content Recommendations (RL).
        - Drug Discovery (RL).
        - Multimodal models (CNN, LSTM, GAN).
        - Eble to draw (GAN).
        - Continuousness?
        - Emotion?
    - NLP:
        - Transformer Architecture (GPT series or BERT?)
        - Model Size: 1 million parameters. Later, try  billions or even hundreds of billions of parameters?
        - Training Data: WebText, a dataset scraped from the internet, Scientific papers.
