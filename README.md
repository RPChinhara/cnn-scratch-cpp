Dora is an AI project that aims to behave like a cat. Currently, it's just a simple NN model that can output predictions for the Iris dataset. Gradually, other models like CNN will be added so that it can achieve multimodal AI, initially making it resemble a cat and then gradually bringing it closer to an actual cat.
