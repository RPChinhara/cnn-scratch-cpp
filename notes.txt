[States]
- hunger(the primary biological drive for eating is hunger, which is controlled by the hypothalamus in the brain. When the body's energy stores are depleted, signals are sent to the brain to initiate the feeling of hunger, motivating an individual to seek and consume food), thirst(dehydration or a decrease in the body's water content triggers the sensation of thirst), mental health, blood pressure, blood glucose level, fatigue, hygiene level, hair length, stress level, age, relationship, height and weight, energy level, sleepiness, health status(tooth decay, cancer, diabetes, emphysema, asthma), pain, social interactions, job satisfaction, clothing choices, emotional states, social media activity, weather conditions, temperature(日陰や雨よけ, tide), climate(wind) time of day, location, financial status (income, savings, and debt), education level, pains, feeling of goodness, news, nationality, homeostasis(such as blood sugar levels, electrolyte balance, and body temperature), emotions(such as stress, boredom, sadness, or happiness), self-esteem level(influences psychological well-being), auditory system, visual system, sense of smell, taste somatosensory system, goals(e.g., first and foremost simply survive, become leader of the group if he was a crocodile).

[Actions]
- EAT(meat, vegetable), EXERCISE, SLEEP, SOCIALIZE (talk), hydrate, work(earn money), learn, get a haircut, brush teeth, take a bath/shower, grooming, play some sports, get sun, drinking, smoking, healthcare (go to the hospital, dentist...), shop, changing careers, moving to a new location, social media, entertainment (watch movies), transportation (how to commute or travel), clean the house, drive, move stuff, digestion, reproduction(such as mating, parenting, and ensuring the survival of their offspring).

[Insights]
- Experts say the current models need 'Search system', but what it is?
- How to let him have curiosity for Science e.g., Mathematics, AI, Physics so that he will try to solve problems within these fields.
- I need to set the camera focused on him, and spawn objects e.g., food, water, possible friends, and predators etc to let him explore the environment.
- I need to save parameters such as weights, biases, and Q-table. How do you do in TF?
- Learning about why animals and human's primary purposes for living I guess making good environment might be key? If they need to adapt to environment, it needs to change over time e.g., global warming, we have to adapt to new techs.
- While primary purposes for both human and animals are driven by the principles of survival(finding food, avoiding predators, and adapting to environmental challenges(Natural selection favors traits that enhance an organism's chances of survival and reproduction in a given environment)) and reproduction. However, humans often seek additional sources of meaning and purpose. These may include personal fulfillment, relationships, contributions to society.
- All the behaviors are influenced by a combination of biological, psychological, social, and cultural factors.
- Learn how human memory works, and integrate memory for him?
- He needs to take various nutrition such as carbohydrates, proteins, fats, vitamins, and minerals through food these adequate nutrition is crucial for energy production, growth, and the maintenance and repair of bodily tissues so perhaps in the future I have to program so that not he only eats, but have to eat in good balance.

- Psychologists distinguish between extrinsic motivation, which means being moved to do something because of some specific rewarding outcome, and intrinsic motivation, which refers to being moved to do something because it is inherently enjoyable. Intrinsic motivation leads organisms to engage in exploration, play, and other behavior driven by curiosity in the absence of explicit reward. [...] Although these arguments are compelling, developmental approaches to artificial agent design have been slow to penetrate the mainstream of the machine learning community.
- an agent should address new goals forever
- Yann says RL requires insane amount of trials. How can I reduce this? He also says idea that humans and animals possess common sense, and their behavior is motivated by specific goals or objectives, which are often referred to as drives. Common sense here implies a practical understanding of the world and the ability to make decisions based on that understanding. The mention of "drives" suggests that both humans and animals are guided by their inherent needs, instincts, or motivations when determining their actions.
- use PowerPlay? https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00313/full
- Try automatically inventing or discovering problems in a way inspired by the playful behavior of animals and humans (PowerPlay).
- Run environments the GPU instead of CPU for like multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) research.
- Try open-ended RL?
- Maybe in the future hide the food and water? As in the real nature animals have to work hard to get those rewards. e.g., crocodiles hunting zebras
- 植物はどうやって生きてる？　例、木など
- Why I mentioned about recent news kn Kishida president? It because he’s the current president of Japan, about he reduced taxes became news on medias, Japan is in ressesion(current economic status in Japan), I was interested
- Make a global variables called is_action_up, down, left, and right will be switched in WindowsProc()
- add music to the simulation like Pokemon
- When action is set talk, set states as current situation such as holding a leaf sets alphabet as actions so that it can chose a word ‘leaf!’ Like baby would say.
- how to hide the taskbar when window is displayed?
- create class Agent?
- should other agent randomly moving? NPCs are moving in GTA, but not in Pokemon. IRL obviously people or everything is moving.   
- 俺が餌あげないと死ぬ
- State is speak so speak up the objects in front of him before that use classification to determine what it is.
- Why do we say back ‘Hello’?
- Has most recent and future goals example of former would be to go for a walk to reduce stress level, and for former will be to solve Physics problems.
- He has to educate himself to solve problems associated with Pythysics or in naturaly to survibe.
- The book 'Why Greatness Cannot Be Planned' proposes to follow the interesting and the novel instead. The authors developed an algorithm called novelty search, where instead of optimizing an objective, the agent just tries out behaviors that are as novel to it as possible, but I realized that paper 'Reward is Enough' came 6 years after this so not sure...
- While the agent interacting with the environment it should train nn for like classification tasks?
- Add memory like using nn for classification task?
- Maybe there might be RL within Rl? e.g., within the states he decide to do puzzle game in order to learn new words at this point use another RL? I mean human is also like that meaning it’s like layers of RL. In order to live, you have to work, and within the work you have to do certatin tasks.

- Fuzzy reinforcement learning
- Safe reinforcement learning
- knowledge, learning, perception, social intelligence, language, generalisation, imitation, and general intelligence.
- multi-objective learning, risk-sensitive objectives, or objectives that are specified by a human-in-the-loop.
- biological brains are hardwired to interpret signals such as pain and hunger as negative reinforcements, and interpret pleasure and food intake as positive reinforcements. I
