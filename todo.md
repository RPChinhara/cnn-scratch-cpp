1. Working on a tutorial https://www.tensorflow.org/text/tutorials/nmt_with_attention
  - Implement SimpleRNN
    > Implement backpropagation.
  - Implement LSTM.
  - Implement GRU.
  - Implement Bidirectional RNNs.
  - Implement Deep RNNs, which have multiple layers of RNNs stacked on top of each other and can be built with any of the basic RNN units (vanilla, LSTM, GRU).
  - Fix nn to use wx + b equation instead of current xw + b
2. Implement CNN.
3. Work on other tutorials on TensorFlow sites, e.g., Neural machine translation with a Transformer and Keras.
4. Implement other famous modles like BERT, ConvLSTM.
5. Implement interesting algorithms from papers.
6. Come up with your own architectures, algorithms, and models learned from papers.
7. Use the best models, possibly autoregressive transformer models, to solve existing problems and discover new theories in mathematics and physics.
8. Create new things, possibly scientific devices, from 7.
