- Develop my own architectures, algorithms, and models. Maybe tip is like Hopfield did use tools from physics, biology, chemistry, and so on as these represents/explains the nature. For instance, Newton's laws of motion?
- Solve existing problems and discover new theories in mathematics and physics
