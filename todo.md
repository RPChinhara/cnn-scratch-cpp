1. Implement Seq2seq (Just use ChatGPT and Google? Come back to the tutorials on Tensorflow sites if it was impossible)
  > Implement CNN
  - Implement ConvLSTM
2. Implement Transformer
3. Implement Autoencoder
4. Imeplement BERT
5. Implement GAN
6. Implement BART
7. Implement Mamba
8. Implement ResNet
9. Develop my own architectures, algorithms, and models. Maybe tip is like Hopfield did use tools from physics, biology, chemistry, and so on as these represents/explains the nature. For instance, Newton's laws of motion?
10. Solve existing problems and discover new theories in mathematics and physics
