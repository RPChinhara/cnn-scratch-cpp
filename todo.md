- Implement Seq2seq (Just use ChatGPT and Google? Come back to the tutorials on Tensorflow sites if it was impossible)
  > Implement LSTM
    - better than this return? std::tuple<std::vector<tensor>, std::vector<tensor>, std::vector<tensor>, std::vector<tensor>> forward(const tensor &x, enum Phase phase);
    - return z in nn?
  - Implement GRU (many-to-many).
  - Implement Bidirectional RNNs.
  - Implement Deep RNNs, which have multiple layers of RNNs stacked on top of each other and can be built with any of the basic RNN units (vanilla, LSTM, GRU).
  - Implement CNN.
  - Implement ConvLSTM.
  - Implement Transformer
3. Implement algorithms/modles from latest/famous/interesting papers.
4. Develop my own architectures, algorithms, and models. Maybe tip is like Hopfield did use tools from physics, biology, chemistry, and so on as these represents/explains the nature. For instance, Newton's laws of motion?
5. Use '4' to solve existing problems and discover new theories in mathematics and physics.
6. Create new things, possibly scientific devices, using '4' and/or '5'.
