1. Implement Seq2seq (Just use ChatGPT and Google? Come back to the tutorials on Tensorflow sites if it was impossible)
  > Implement LSTM
  - Implement GRU (many-to-many, and no translation app as dealing with other language sucks so maybe text generation).
  - Implement Bidirectional RNNs.
  - Implement Deep RNNs, which have multiple layers of RNNs stacked on top of each other and can be built with any of the basic RNN units (vanilla, LSTM, GRU).
  - Implement CNN.
  - Implement ConvLSTM.
2. Implement Transformer, Autoencoder, BERT, GAN, BART
3. Implement algorithms/modles from latest/famous/interesting papers.
4. Develop my own architectures, algorithms, and models. Maybe tip is like Hopfield did use tools from physics, biology, chemistry, and so on as these represents/explains the nature. For instance, Newton's laws of motion?
5. Solve existing problems and discover new theories in mathematics and physics.
