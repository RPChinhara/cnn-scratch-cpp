1. Working on a tutorial https://www.tensorflow.org/text/tutorials/nmt_with_attention
  > Implement LSTM
  - Implement GRU (many-to-many).
  - Implement Bidirectional RNNs.
  - Implement Deep RNNs, which have multiple layers of RNNs stacked on top of each other and can be built with any of the basic RNN units (vanilla, LSTM, GRU).
  - Implement CNN.
  - Implement ConvLSTM.
2. Work on other tutorials on TensorFlow sites, e.g., Neural machine translation with a Transformer and Keras.
3. Implement algorithms from latest/famous/interesting papers.
4. Develop my own architectures, algorithms, and models. Maybe tip is like Hopfield did use tools from physics, biology, chemistry, and so on as these represents/explains the nature. For instance, Newton's laws of motion?
5. Use '4' to solve existing problems and discover new theories in mathematics and physics.
6. Create new things, possibly scientific devices, using '4' and/or '5'.
