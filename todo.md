> LeNet
- AlexNet
     - Use ImageNet as the model was made for the dataset? It seems this is the way. -> I guess I can just use MNIST or other dataset that is less computation heavy so that I could proceed forward quickly.
     - I may not perfectly replicate AlexNet, VGG, and ResNet as these are just bigger version of LeNet so I might make similar models, but may not be exactly same.
