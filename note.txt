[States]
- hunger(start with negative hunger?), thirstiness, mental health, blood pressure, blood glucose level, hygiene level, hair length, stress level, age, relationship, height and weight, energy level, sleepiness, health status(tooth decay, cancer, diabetes, emphysema, asthma), pain, social interactions, job satisfaction, clothing choices, emotional states, social media activity, weather conditions, temperature, time of day, location, financial status (income, savings, and debt), education level.

NOTE: First start with 3 states which are hunger, thirstiness, and mental health each have 5 states (very hungry, hungry, neutral, full, very full), (very thirsty, thirsty, neutral, satisfied, very satisfied), (very stressed, stressed, neutral, content, happy) which means 5 (hunger) * 5 (thirstiness) * 5 (mental health) = 125 states.

[Actions]
- EAT(meat, vegetable), EXERCISE, SLEEP, SOCIALIZE (talk), hydrate, work(earn money), learn, get a haircut, brush teeth, take a bath/shower, grooming, play some sports, get sun, drinking, smoking, healthcare (go to the hospital, dentist...), shop, changing careers, moving to a new location, social media, entertainment (watch movies), transportation (how to commute or travel).

NOTE: Similar to actions, first start with 4 actions which are eat, exercise, sleep, socialize. Can perform these actions at various levels of intensity which are 3 levels (low, medium, high). In this case, it would be 3 levels for each of the 4 actions, resulting in a total of 3^4 = 81 possible action combinations.

TODO: I could go more detail e.g., 
Food Type: Specify the type of food the agent can choose to eat, such as healthy options (vegetables, fruits, lean proteins) or unhealthy options (fast food, sugary snacks).
Portion Size: Define different portion sizes (small, medium, large) for the agent's meals.
Meal Timing: Determine when the agent can eat (breakfast, lunch, dinner, snacks).

Q-table would have 125 (states) * 81 (action combinations) rows and columns, resulting in a total of 10,125 cells in the table.

[Insights]
- First create survival agent who tried to keep the life with no graphics, and maybe start off with Q-Learning.
ニャーと声を発する
-Add another agent
-仕切りを作る
-俺が餌あげないと死ぬ
-Make the window bigger
-実際の時間と合わせる　while done
-State is speak so speak up the objects in front of him before that use classification to determine what it is.
-Why do we say back ‘Hello’?
- What is considered done? Maybe it dosen't need to be done as it's not real living things which have ages.
- Get reward when successefully eaten
- First create cat like creature? Where goals are to juat live(but for how long?) and eat.
- What about creating myself e.g., wake up at the mansion, get reward when went for a walk, eaten.
- Goals (live 80 years, solve physics probs)
- Looks adult, but brain in immature. Meybe he dosen’t have to be baby might be already an adult?
- First start a goal of living 10 days by working to earn money and eat
- Goals (live 10 days, learn 10 words using nested RL)
- Earn ¥300000 per month, but can’t able to if he’s not humble enough (party too much, not living healthy enouth)
- Q-Learning -> Deep Q-Network (DQN) -> Double DQN (DDQN) -> Dueling DQN -> Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG)
- text-based environments
- reference OpenAI's Gym (Gymnasium now?)
- Simulate the agent was born in urban city as we are.
- Can he surived meaning keep all the status as high as possible e.g., life, weight.
- maximising survival time, minimising pain, maximising healthy food, avoiding accidents
- he needs to escape from pradetors e.g., lion, crocodile so it may become injured
- How to teach him a thing is scary or cute.
- Has most recent and future goals example of former would be to go for a walk to reduce stress level, and for former will be to solve Physics problems.
- He has to educate himself to solve problems associated with Pythysics or in naturaly to survibe.
- The book 'Why Greatness Cannot Be Planned' proposes to follow the interesting and the novel instead. The authors developed an algorithm called novelty search, where instead of optimizing an objective, the agent just tries out behaviors that are as novel to it as possible, but I realized that paper 'Reward is Enough' came 6 years after this so not sure...
- While the agent interacting with the environment it should train nn for like classification tasks?
- Maybe in the future the agent can add new actions he came up with?
- Done = true if the agent found new physics theory or go to toilet or earn money ?
- Ideal plan is the agent interacts env like 2d pokemon world -> 3d pokemon or GTA world -> VR, but I guess I can accomplish the physics goal with 2d pokemon world so delete terraria idea. In 2d pokemon world add dialogues maybe using LLMs so that the agent can manipulate language which is super important. First, create one small city like the one in Pokemon?
- Add memory like using nn for classification task?
- 経済、治安、会社に就職
- Start from a baby maybe who has parents
- Starts from a house
- Get a reward if his height grew, and learned new language
- Maybe there might be RL within Rl? e.g., within the states he decide to do puzzle game in order to learn new words at this point use another RL? I mean human is also like that meaning it’s like layers of RL. In order to live, you have to work, and within the work you have to do certatin tasks.
- Start simple maybe actions would be just eat, sleep, excersise or something. I need to write a program when for example if sleep action is chose the agent has to walk up to the bed and go to bed.
- Needs body parts e.g., arms, legs.
    - Make scientific devices based on *1.
- Able to talk through audio.

- Might be in nature or urban city? It'd be fun if I could make simulation that begins with home sapines proceed to year 3000 ~ 5000, and I can steal some technologies from there.
- Might be newly born baby or animal like a monkey?
- Check Comparison of reinforcement learning algorithms on https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning
- also check out reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) 
- First create a body in 2D resembles Stardew Valley, Terraria, pokemon. In 3D, Minecraft?

- multi-objective learning, risk-sensitive objectives, or objectives that are specified by a human-in-the-loop.
- multiple agents, multiple environments?
- He looks and behaves like human being has 2 arms, legs.
- biological brains are hardwired to interpret signals such as pain and hunger as negative reinforcements, and interpret pleasure and food intake as positive reinforcements. I
- How can he act like a mosquito?
- Social intelligence is the ability to understand and interact effectively with other agents. This ability is often formalised, using game theory.
- Build human aged between 3 ~ 5.
- How to teach him words like banana actually showing banana. Not like how chatGPT is recoginising banana (predicting probable next words).
- ability to imitate
- memory, imagination, common sense, attention, reasoning, creativity
- *1 Discover new theories in Scinece, and come up with new scientific devices (Phyiscs, Mathematics, Chemistry).
Study Existing Theories - > Identify Shortcomings or Gaps - > Develop Mathematical Framework - > Make Predictions - > Seek Peer Review - > Experimental Verification - > Iterate and Refine. Can it do it?
- For example, consider a signal that provides +1 reward to the agent each time a round-shaped pebble is collected. In order to maximise this reward signal effectively, an agent may need to classify pebbles, to manipulate pebbles, to navigate to pebble beaches, to store pebbles, to understand waves and tides and their effect on pebble distribution, to persuade people to help collect pebbles, to use tools and vehicles to collect greater quantities, to quarry and shape new pebbles, to discover and build new technologies for collecting pebbles, or to build a corporation that collects pebbles.

- Transformer Architecture (GPT series or BERT?)
- Model Size: 1 million parameters. Later, try  billions or even hundreds of billions of parameters?
- Training Data: WebText, a dataset scraped from the internet, Scientific papers.

- I thought NLP is the core of the AGI, but it might not as the case for Computer vision, and other things like continuousness be as dogs which don't use as high level language as we do, yet behave as more high intelligent creatures better than ChatGPT. Like it is quite dumb that it dosen't know what apple is, but if I could teach RL what it is it might be able to recoginise what it is like human does.
- game theory is important?
- Get ideas from wild animal like the one in Africa.
- RL is typically not used for classification problems. It would be like trying to teach someone to recognize animals by showing them a picture of a dog, not telling them what it is, letting them guess, and then giving them a treat if they're right or a gentle admonishment if they're wrong. However, there are complex problems that have elements of both RL and classification. For example, in a robotic control problem, the robot might need to classify objects in its environment (using supervised learning) and then decide how to interact with them based on that classification (using reinforcement learning).
