Create Sequences:
----------------
Given following dataset, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10], and I have to create sequence length of 3 it'd be
[1, 2, 3], [2, 3, 4], [3, 4, 5], [4, 5, 6], [5, 6, 7], [6, 7, 8], [7, 8, 9], [8, 9, 10] which is exactly what create_sequences() does.
However, inside forward() I decompose these so that I can process in batches like below,
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8], [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9], and [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10].
So after all, I don't know if create_sequences() is really neccessaly I just did it since all the Python rnn examples do.
