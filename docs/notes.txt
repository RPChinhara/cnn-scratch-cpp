AGI
----------------
- Use a multimodal model to predict physical phenomena and solve unsolved problems, e.g., predict quantum gravity.
    - Given text, image, and video datasets as a multimodal inputs, predict next tokens. For instance, predict various unknown phenomena in unsolved physics problems.
    - Things to predict
        - Wave function
        - Near the black hole
        - Space time
- I might need Fugaku or cloud computing for this.
