AGI
----------------
- Use a multimodal model to predict physical phenomena and solve unsolved problems, e.g., predict quantum gravity.
    - Given text, image, and video datasets as a multimodal inputs, predict next tokens. For instance, predict various unknown phenomena in unsolved physics problems.
    - Things to predict
        - Wave function
        - Near the black hole
        - Space time
- I might need Fugaku or cloud computing for this.
- Will quantum neural network really work?
    - It needs quantum computers, and as of now it's an experimental stuff.
- If I made a best NLP model, and train it for a year, will it surpass or be as close as chatGPT?
- In the future, I need to save parameters like weights and biases, and keep updating these to make a better model like how transfer learning works.
- Obviously, RNNs are replaced by the Transformer, but are CNNs as well?
