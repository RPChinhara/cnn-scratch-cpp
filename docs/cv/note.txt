Analysis:
----------------
- LeNet5 wasn't working, however after I used only 1 conv (1 ~ 2 output channels) and pooling, it started working. Is it because model is simply smaller?
- With 1 convolution (kernel size = (5, 1, 5, 5)) and max polling, the model is able to generalize.
- With 1 convolution (kernel size = (20, 1, 5, 5)) and max polling, the model is able to generalize. Though, loss is better when the number of output channels were 5. Loss started increasing after 5th epoch from 0.0447699 to 0.0619511, and to 0.0789601 at 6th epoch.
- With 1 convolution (kernel size = (50, 1, 5, 5)) and max polling, the model is not able to generalize. It behaves almost identical to the first LeNet5 model I replicated.
- Losses around 0.06 ~ 0.07 indicated models have generalized to datasets?
