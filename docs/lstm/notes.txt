-------------------- Why use vslice in BPTT? --------------------

Slice weights to (50, 50) from (50, 51) for using only columns multiplied to h. See example below.
Only 1s and 2s will be multiplied to values that are h. All 3s are multpiled to x, and I only care about
weights that are contributing to h because whem I'm trying to get gradients respect to h like below do_10/dw_o, dc_tilde_10/dw_c,
all I care is how much weights are related from this concatenation w * [h + x].
1 2 3          3 3 3 3 2 2 2 2 2 2 this is h
1 2 3          3 3 3 3 2 2 2 2 2 2 this is h
1 2 3          3 3 3 3 2 2 2 2 2 2 this is x
